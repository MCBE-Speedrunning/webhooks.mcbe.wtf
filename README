webhooks.mcbe.wtf
=================

A service used to recieve push events from GitHub and send a friendly message
through a Discord webhook.

Goal
----

GitHub can't filter by itself which branches we want to recieve push events,
and as such we need to write an application to do this for us.

Development
-----------

Use deno v1.43.5 or higher.

Deployment
----------

Deployment can be done through the `deploy.sh` script, which will publish the
project to Deno Deploy, then promote it to "prod" and set environmental
variables from the .env file

The required variables are:

- GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET
	* A secret that GitHub and this application must share
- GITHUB_WEBHOOK_REF
	- What git ref to listen to. For example "master"
- DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
	- What discord webhook URL to send the message to
